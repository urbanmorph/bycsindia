            <h5>Bhairavi Joshi</h5>
            <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">Director & CEO</p>
            <p class="font-weight-light text-justify small">Dr Bhairavi Naik Joshi is Director and CEO at the BYCS India Foundation. With a vision in mind to see India transform into a cycling nation, she came up with the idea of setting up the BYCS India foundation, which is being supported and implemented by BYCS.<br>
            Bhairavi is a dentist by profession and has been in practice for 20 years. She is also the former Bicycle Mayor of Valsad, Gujarat, India and has been instrumental in bringing a cycling culture to her city. She believes that if cities are fit for children to cycle and walk, then they are safe for the entire community. Among other cycling activities, she has introduced a “cycling curriculum” which has been adopted by many schools as well as other Bicycle Mayors. <br>
            She has also worked towards several social causes. She initiated the Mango Children’s Literature Festival, which has published 34 books by children, as a way to promote creative thinking and writing among children. Her published works, “Fuel Your Thoughts”, a self-help book for women and “Ozone Saviours”, dedicated to cycling culture, are some of her most notable accomplishments. Throughout her career, she has been recognized by various private and governmental entities for her social efforts. Bhairavi is also a TED speaker and has spoken at various urbanism conferences such as Australian Cycling and Walking Conference 2018 and India Cycling Festival 2018.</p>

            <h5>Maarten Woolthuis</h5>
            <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">Director</p>
            <p class="font-weight-light text-justify small">Maarten worked for a number of years across all disciplines related to transport, from managing public tenders to launching new technologies, running public-private contracts, overseeing communications campaigns and building effective stakeholder collaborations. But it was his passion for active mobility and sustainable transportation that led to him to help establish Bike to Work, a business using smart technology and engagement to increase cycling uptake amongst commuters. Seeing the impact of this on individuals, organizations and communities, he then looked to co-found BYCS to take the impact of increased cycling to the city level. He is motivated by the radical transformation that breakthrough ideas around cycling can bring.</p>

            <h5>Daniel Eppstien</h5>
            <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">Operations Manager</p>
            <p class="font-weight-light text-justify small">Daniel is enthusiastic about the potential of cities in the future and the impact they will have on improving the lives of millions, yet wary of the influence of current frameworks of thinking, stuck patterns of behavior, and the vast inequality in today’s capitalistic society. He believes that the health of a city is directly related to the degree to which it successfully addresses the education, housing, and transportation needs of its residents. To thrive rather than merely survive, people need inspired places to live – filled with art, passive and active open space, creative and effective transportation solutions, and opportunities for community interaction. His passion lies in the development of the modern city and believes, as BYCS does, that the bicycle can bring us one major step closer to the realization of what seems like a Utopian world today. <br>
            Daniel has a background in Sociology and years of start-up experience specialising in product value realisation, spatial development, online/offline integration, full-stack development, and scaling. He’s excited to connect the many solutions that BYCS offers to a cohesive and connected package that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

            <h5>Poly Bhatt</h5>
            <p class="font-weight-light mb-0">Community Manager</p>
            <p class="font-weight-light text-justify small">Poly has always been curious about the potential of digital technologies and online social platforms to facilitate cultural change. She was able to explore this curiosity academically in the Master’s program New Media & Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam. Learning about grassroots movements that transformed into full-blown revolutions under a hashtag symbolised for her an exciting, new and more inclusive age of democracy. Driven by a passion for politics, social justice, planet awareness and plant-based sustenance, she managed to combine her interests with her professional work within the editorial team of a sustainability-focused startup in Amsterdam.<br>
            She was then naturally drawn to BYCS’s conscientious mission to better the environment, human health and community on a global scale. Working with a diverse and international network of trailblazers at BYCS has not only been fulfilling, but has more importantly shown her that the common goal of a green future can unite people across borders.</p>
